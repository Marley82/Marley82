Hi, I'm starting this journey in 2022/3 with a new found interest in all things coding. I did a 'bootcamp' as an alternative to gaming or real life parenting.
I'm way too old to be strating out at this but it's pretty fun so I'm going to be push on regardless.

I've learnt JavaScript, a tiny bit of Python, HTML, CSS, JSX React.js Node.js and a few other little bit and now I hope to wow you all with me ongoing output of gold
pure gold!

Check out my Hangman-React-redux app, I'm pretty proud of it!
